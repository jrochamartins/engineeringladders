# Carreira de engenharia

**Este documento e toda sua estrutura não representam um documento oficial do contratante do mantenedor do repositório e destina-se somente a uso pessoal.**

O framework permite que os líderes de engenharia de software tenham conversas significativas com seus liderados diretos sobre as expectativas de cada posição e como planejar o próximo nível em sua carreira.

Esse framework foi traduzido da estrutura original em www.engineeringladders.com e adaptado para um cotidiano particular.

São usados gráficos de radar para representar visualmente as diferentes perspectivas e expectativas de uma determinada posição:

# Carreiras

* [**Software Developer**](Developer.md): Papel também conhecido como pessoa desenvolvedora, programador ou engenheiro de software, requer um profundo nível de conhecimento técnico.

| Nível | [Software Developer](Developer.md) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | [Software Developer](Developer.md#d1---developer-1) |
| 2 | [Software Developer I](Developer.md#d2---developer-2) |
| 3 | [Software Developer II](Developer.md#d3---developer-3) |
| 4 | [Software Developer III](Developer.md#d4---developer-4) |
| 5 | [Software Developer Specialist](Developer.md#d5---developer-5) |

# Eixos

O gráfico mostrado acima tem os seguintes 5 eixos:
* **Tecnologia**: conhecimento da pilha de tecnologia e ferramentas.
* **Sistema**: nível de 'ownership' no(s) sitema(s) e produto(s).
* **Pessoas**: Relacionamento com o time e demais colaboradores.
* **Processos**: Nível de engajamento com o processo de desenvolvimento.
* **Influência**: Escopo de influência da posição.

The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that *evangelizes* technology, *specializes* and *adopts* it as well.

Keep reading to better understand each level.

# Levels

## Technology

1. **Adopts**: actively learns and adopts the technology and tools defined by the team
2. **Specializes**: is the go-to person for one or more technologies and takes initiative to learn new ones
3. **Evangelizes**: researches, creates proofs of concept and introduces new technologies to the team
4. **Masters**: has very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system
5. **Creates**: designs and creates new technologies that are widely used either by internal or external teams

## System

1. **Enhances**: successfully pushes new features and bug fixes to improve and extend the system
2. **Designs**: designs and implements medium to large size features while reducing the system's tech debt
3. **Owns**: owns the production operation and monitoring of the system and is aware of its SLAs
4. **Evolves**: evolves the architecture to support future requirements and defines its SLAs
5. **Leads**: leads the technical excellence of the system and creates plans to mitigate outages

## People

1. **Learns**: quickly learns from others and consistently steps up when it is required
2. **Supports**: proactively supports other team members and helps them to be successful
3. **Mentors**: mentors others to accelerate their career-growth and encourages them to participate
4. **Coordinates**: coordinates team members providing effective feedback and moderating discussions
5. **Manages**: manages the team members' career, expectations, performance and level of happiness

## Process

1. **Follows**: follows the team processes, delivering a consistent flow of features to production
2. **Enforces**: enforces the team processes, making sure everybody understands the benefits and tradeoffs
3. **Challenges**: challenges the team processes, looking for ways to improve them
4. **Adjusts**: adjusts the team processes, listening to feedback and guiding the team through the changes
5. **Defines**: defines the right processes for the team's maturity level, balancing agility and discipline

## Influence

1. **Subsystem**: makes an impact on one or more subsystems
2. **Team**: makes an impact on the whole team, not just on specific parts of it
3. **Multiple Teams**: makes an impact not only his/her team but also on other teams
4. **Company**: makes an impact on the whole tech organization
5. **Community**: makes an impact on the tech community

# FAQs

**What if some of the people don't meet all the points?**

That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.

**What if my organization's career ladder is different?**

Since the framework is open source, you have the opportunity to adapt it to your organization. Feel free to use the [chart template](charts/template.png) to define your own levels.

**When is a person ready to move to the next level?**

Companies usually expect a person to be performing at the next level *consistently for several months* before formalizing a promotion.

**How do I collect evidence to support the discussion with my direct reports?**

Different teams collect evidence in different ways. A recommended approach is to use a combination of:
* 1:1 conversations
* Feedback from peers and other teams
* Self-evaluation

**Could the framework provide more specific examples of behavior to support each level?**

Specific examples of behavior require knowledge about the way that the team works, the system architecture and its technology stack. It is recommended to allow each team to define their own examples.

**Why does the framework stop at level 7?**

Levels 8 and above vary drastically from company to company. Organizations of different sizes tend to assign a diverse level of scope to positions so high in their structure.

**Do you have any additional resources about the topic?**

* [The Manager's Path](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do): Camille Fournier does an excellent job at describing the expectations and challenges of many engineering positions. Also, she provides good advice about writing a career ladder in chapter 9.

* [How to Be Good at Performance Appraisals](https://store.hbr.org/product/how-to-be-good-at-performance-appraisals-simple-effective-done-right/10295): Dick Grote explains in simple terms how to define job responsibilities and how to evaluate performance (results and behaviors).
